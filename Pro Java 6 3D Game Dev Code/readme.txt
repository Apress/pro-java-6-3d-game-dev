Getting this Code to Work (Part 1)

I sometimes get queries about the code "not compiling" or "not working".
It does compile and work, but you need to install Java first,
and then any additional API libraries (e.g. Java 3D, JOGL,
JOAL, JInput).

Start by installing the latest version of the Java SE Development Kit 
at http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp. As of March 2007, 
that's JDK 6.</P>

I use many extra libraries that aren't part of the development
kit. Details on how to download and install them can be found at the 
start of the first chapter describing them, and in the readme.txt 
files that come with the examples. The relevant first chapters:

* Java 3D: chapter 2
* Odejava: chapter 5
* JMF and Twain: chapter 9
* JInput: chapter 11
* JOAL: chapter 13
* Carl Kenner's P5 Data Glove API: chapter 14
* JOGL: chapter 15

---------------------------------
Getting my Code to Work (Part 2)

Each of the code directories contains its own readme.txt
file which explains how to compile and execute that 
chapter's examples.
